Adaptive Mutation and Crossover Rates:

	Dynamically adjust rates based on convergence speed and diversity metrics.

Elitism Integration:

	Preserve top-k individuals each generation to maintain best-known solutions.

Hybrid Heuristics:

	Introduce local search (e.g., simulated annealing) for refined exploitation.
