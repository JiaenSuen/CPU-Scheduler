# CPU-Scheduler
CPU Scheduler is a simulation project focused on solving CPU task matching and scheduling problems. It leverages both heuristic and optimization algorithms to intelligently search for near-optimal or optimal solutions.The project is designed to explore how intelligent algorithms can improve the efficiency of CPU task allocation and scheduling, which is a crucial topic in computer systems and operating system design.  
This project was developed as part of the Evolutionary Computation course project at National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology (NKUST). It serves as an academic experiment in applying techniques such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and other metaheuristics to classical CPU scheduling problems. The aim is not only to achieve high-quality solutions but also to gain insight into how different algorithmic strategies behave under various system loads and constraints.  
The simulation supports a variety of scheduling objectives, such as minimizing average waiting time, turnaround time, and maximizing CPU utilization. It also includes a visualization module to help understand the scheduling process and algorithm performance over time.
